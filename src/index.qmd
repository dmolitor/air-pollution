## Abstract

Intergenerational economic mobility varies widely within the U.S. 
Understanding the characteristics of places with high vs. low 
economic mobility has been the focus of a substantial body of 
recent research. In this visualization, I explore an additional
correlate of economic mobility; ambient air pollution. Exposure 
to ambient air pollution has been shown to have negative
long-term physical, cognitive, and economic impacts, with 
particularly acute effects on children. Using comprehensive 
satellite measures of air pollution over time, I show a 
striking geographic correlation between areas with relatively
high levels of air pollution and relatively low levels of 
intergenerational economic mobility. This visualization 
provides supporting evidence that air pollution may play a 
role in maintaining the cycle of low economic mobility throughout 
many areas of the U.S. due to its many harmful effects.

## Description

Intergenerational economic mobility within the U.S. is highly
heterogeneous, with large differences in mobility between 
geographic regions, e.g. much of the Midwest and Southeast 
[@chetty_where_2014]. There are many distinguishing characteristics
of places with high vs. low economic mobility, a number of which 
have been studied at length. One such characteristic that 
has escaped significant focus within the economic mobility
literature is ambient air pollution. The harmful 
effects of ambient air pollution on long-term physical, cognitive, 
and economic outcomes have been widely studied, and have been 
shown to be particularly detrimental to children. Currie et al.
[-@currie_traffic_2011] show that air pollution from traffic 
congestion leads to increased risk of health complications, 
including low birth weight, among newborns which, in turn, has 
been shown to have significantly negative effects on future 
outcomes. Wodtke et al. [-@wodtke_concentrated_2022] show that 
exposure to ambient air pollution leads to decreased cognitive 
ability in children, lower educational achievement, and worse 
future economic outcomes. Additionally, Borgschulte et al. 
[-@borgschulte_air_2022] show that ambient air pollution leads 
to significant declines in labor market outcomes and productivity. 
These findings provide a strong basis to suspect that air pollution 
may serve as a mechanism for lower intergenerational economic mobility. 
To descriptively examine this potential mechanism, I map the 
relationship between ambient air pollution (fine particulate matter) 
and intergenerational economic mobility across the contiguous 
United States.

Using administrative census and tax records, Chetty et al.
[-@chetty_where_2014] estimate economic mobility as a child's expected income
percentile in the national income distribution at age 30 if they were
born to a family in the 25th percentile of the national income distribution.
I then pair these measures of economic mobility with comprehensive 
measures of mean monthly particulate matter (PM 2.5) in µg/m³ across the
contiguous U.S. [@van_donkelaar_monthly_2021]. All measures of economic
mobility and air pollution are measured or aggregated at the
[commuting zone](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commuting-zones-and-labor-market-areas/)
geographic level. [Figure 1](index.qmd#fig-1) displays economic 
mobility and mean air pollution
quartiles (dividing economic mobility and air pollution measures into 4 even
bins) for each commuting zone across the contiguous U.S.

![Economic Mobility and Air Pollution](mobility-and-pollution.png){#fig-1}
The correlation between below-median air pollution quality and below-median
economic mobility is striking, with large swatches of the southwest and midwest
falling in both the quartile of the worst air pollution and the quartile of
the worst economic mobility. Although there are some areas of the U.S. that fall
into one extreme but not the other (e.g. bad air pollution but good economic
mobility), these areas are the exception and not the rule. To quantify the
strength of this correlation I estimate an OLS of the form
$y_i=\beta_1 + \beta_2x_i + \epsilon_i$ where $i$ is the commuting zone, $x$ is
the mean annual PM 2.5 (in µg/m³), and $y$ is the mean economic mobility (in
income percentile ranks). The resulting coefficient of interest is
$\beta_2=$-1.885 (p < 0.001), which can be interpreted as follows: on average,
a one-µg/m³ increase in a commuting zone's PM 2.5 pollution levels corresponds
with a -1.885 decrease in economic mobility.

This figure brings to attention the striking relationship between 
ambient air pollution levels and economic mobility. It also provides 
supporting evidence for air pollution playing a role in the perpetuation 
of low economic mobility. Additionally, it motivates a deeper examination 
of air pollution as a potentially causal mechanism for economic mobility. 
Finally, it exemplifies the usage of cutting-edge, satellite-based 
measures of air pollution for gaining a comprehensive understanding 
of the relationship between air pollution and social systems.
